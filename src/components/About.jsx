        <p className="mb-4">
          During my senior high year, I started to develop the web with a basic
          knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. I continued and aimed to
          study programming since then, because I was curious how the web works
          in a browser.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          After I finished Senior High School, I chose the program Bachelor
          Science of computer Science. I even joined a community group, and
          found a mentor to enhance my skills about web development using React
          JS.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I aim to leverage the wealth of knowledge I've acquired to not only
          enhance my own skills but also to actively contribute to the
          community. This includes sharing insights, best practices, and
          practical experiences with fellow professionals and aspiring learners.
          By doing so, I hope to foster a culture of collaboration, continuous
          learning, and mutual growth within the industry.
